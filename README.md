# SE_FEMA

The premise of this website is that it would be used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate aid efforts during a natural disaster. 

## Features
- server-side app written in Express.js and Node.js to allow users from anywhere to access the site
- SQL database integration for accounts, diaster locations, required/fulfilled resources, etc.
- ability for a FEMA director to add/delete needed resources to the database, then volunteers/drivers/suppliers to fulfil them
- site pages written in Pug
